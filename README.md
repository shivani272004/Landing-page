üìù Project Description:
This project is a simple yet visually appealing Landing Page designed using basic HTML and CSS. It is aimed at beginners who are learning web development. The main objective is to understand how to structure a webpage and apply styling effectively to create a clean and professional look.

The landing page includes different sections like a header, main content area, call-to-action, and a footer. Elements are arranged using boxes and columns to create a clear layout. Special attention is given to alignment, spacing (padding and margin), and color schemes to ensure that the page is visually balanced and nothing overlaps.

This project helps build a strong foundation in front-end development and encourages creativity in design. It‚Äôs also a stepping stone to learning responsive design and adding interactivity with JavaScript in future projects.
